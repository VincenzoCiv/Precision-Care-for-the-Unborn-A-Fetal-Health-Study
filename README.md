# Precision Care for the Unborn: A Fetal Health Study

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a machine learning system to support the diagnosis of fetal patients. The goal is to address the global challenge of reducing fetal mortality rates, particularly in developing countries.

## Data Analysis
The project begins with an initial exploratory data analysis to identify statistical features, leading to the selection of suitable evaluation metrics.

## Data Preprocessing
The data is preprocessed to enhance the performance of machine learning models. This includes handling class imbalance with SMOTE and ENN, data scaling, outlier removal, and feature selection.

## Model Selection and Training
Multiple classification models are evaluated including XGBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine. Hyperparameters are optimized using GridSearchCV.

## Performance Metrics
Model performance is evaluated using F1 Score and Matthews's Correlation Coefficient.

## Results
The system achieves promising results in identifying diseased patients, which is crucial for a diagnostic support system. The reduction of features led to a slight deterioration in performance, but the benefits of feature selection were considered acceptable.
